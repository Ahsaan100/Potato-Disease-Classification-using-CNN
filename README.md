# Potato-Disease-Classification-using-CNN:

In this project a potato disease classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is being developed. The trained CNN model predicts the disease class for each validation image, and the predictions are compared to the ground truth labels. Tools and Technologies the project covers: tensor flow, CNN, data augmentation, tf dataset
